🎓 Another Milestone Unlocked!

I’m excited to share that I’ve just completed my Front End Development Libraries Certification from freeCodeCamp!

After earning my JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certificate, this was the next step in sharpening my frontend skills. I’ve gained hands-on experience with React, Redux, jQuery, Bootstrap, and more — building projects like interactive calculators and dynamic UIs.

Onward to the next challenge and more code adventures! 🚀
